Welcome! I am a master's student in computer engineering at Purdue University. My research interests are materials where quantum mechanics gives rise to extraordinary exotic properties through magnetism, topology, and superconductivity. I am particularly fascinated in controlling magnetic skyrmions in synthetic antiferromagnets.
